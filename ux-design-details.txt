# UX Design Details for Office Duel Card Game

## Overview
Based on the wireframe sketches, here's a comprehensive UX design document that captures the core layout ideas and provides iterations for better testing experience.

## 1. Main Game Board Layout

### Core Structure (From Sketch)
- **Horizontal Division**: Clear separation between enemy area (top) and player area (bottom)
- **Left Sidebar**: Vertical counter/game state indicator
- **Top Right**: Timer placement
- **Central Focus**: Game board with card interactions

### Detailed Layout Breakdown

#### Enemy Area (Top Section)
**Current Implementation:**
- Enemy hand shows only card count (fog of war)
- Enemy tableau shows full cards with effects

**Sketch Ideas & Iterations:**
- **Enemy Hand**: 
  - Display as "Opponent's Hand (X cards)" with visual card backs
  - Consider a stack of 3-5 slightly offset card backs with count overlay
  - No individual card details visible (maintain fog of war)

- **Enemy Tableau**:
  - Full card display with title and effects
  - Same 140x200px card size as player cards
  - Show all effects but don't highlight active ones (opponent's private game state)
  - Clear labeling: "Opponent's Tableau"

#### Player Area (Bottom Section)
**Current Implementation:**
- Player hand with selectable cards
- Player tableau with active effect highlighting

**Sketch Ideas & Iterations:**
- **Player Tableau**:
  - Full card display with title and effects
  - Highlight active effect in green based on card copies
  - Clear labeling: "Your Tableau"
  - Consider visual stacking for multiple copies

- **Player Hand**:
  - 5 cards visible (as per sketch)
  - Each card shows: Title, Effect 1, Effect 2, Effect 3
  - Clear selection state (border/glow when selected)
  - Disabled state when not your turn

#### Shared Elements
**Left Sidebar - Counter:**
- Vertical stack of circles (sketch shows varying sizes)
- Current implementation: Shared dot counter with gradient background
- **Win/Loss Mechanism**: The counter now determines who's winning/losing (replaces HP system)
- Iteration: Add numerical value display alongside visual representation
- Consider progress bar or track with marker for clearer win/loss state indication

**Timer (Top Right):**
- Current: Text-based timer display
- Iteration: Visual countdown with color changes (green → yellow → red)
- Clear indication of whose turn it is
- Consider adding pause/resume functionality

## 2. Card Choice Modal (Second Sketch)

### Modal Design Requirements
**Core Functionality:**
- Appears when opponent must choose between two cards
- Only visible to the choosing player (not the card submitter)
- Clear visual distinction between the two options

**Layout & Content:**
- **Modal Overlay**: Semi-transparent background to focus attention
- **Two Card Display**: Large, prominent card representations
- **Choice Mechanism**: Clear buttons or clickable areas
- **Status Messages**: 
  - For chooser: "Choose between these two cards:"
  - For submitter: "Waiting for opponent to choose..."

**Visual Elements:**
- **Known Card**: Full display with title and effects
- **Unknown Card**: "???" or card back design
- **Selection Buttons**: "Choose This One" buttons below each card
- **Visual Feedback**: Highlight selected option before confirmation

## 3. Enhanced UX Features

### Player Information Display
**Missing from sketches but essential:**
- **Player Names**: "Player A: [Name]" vs "Player B: [Name]"
- **Shared Counter**: The counter now represents win/loss state (no more HP)
- **Active Player Indicator**: Glowing border or arrow showing whose turn
- **Game Phase**: Clear phase indicator (Play Cards, Opponent Pick, etc.)

### Game State Feedback
**Visual Cues:**
- **Turn Transitions**: Smooth animations for turn changes
- **Card Movement**: Subtle animations for cards moving from hand to tableau
- **Selection States**: Clear visual feedback for all interactive elements
- **Action Buttons**: Prominent, well-labeled action buttons

### Responsive Design
**Layout Considerations:**
- **Flexible Grid**: CSS Grid/Flexbox for different screen sizes
- **Card Scaling**: Maintain readability across devices
- **Modal Responsiveness**: Ensure modal works on mobile/tablet
- **Touch Support**: Large enough touch targets for mobile

## 4. Information Architecture

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Primary**: Active player's turn and available actions
2. **Secondary**: Game state (shared counter, timer)
3. **Tertiary**: Opponent information and tableau
4. **Background**: Game log and match info

### Color Coding
- **Green**: Active effects, positive actions, your turn
- **Red**: Negative effects, opponent's turn, warnings
- **Blue**: Neutral actions, shared elements
- **Gray**: Disabled/inactive elements

### Typography
- **Card Titles**: Bold, readable font
- **Effects**: Smaller but clear font
- **UI Labels**: Consistent, medium weight
- **Status Messages**: Prominent, attention-grabbing

## 5. Interaction Patterns

### Card Selection
- **Hover States**: Subtle highlight on hover
- **Selection States**: Clear border/glow when selected
- **Disabled States**: Reduced opacity, no interaction
- **Feedback**: Immediate visual response to clicks

### Modal Interactions
- **Opening**: Smooth fade-in animation
- **Selection**: Clear visual feedback before confirmation
- **Closing**: Automatic close after choice or manual dismiss
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation support

### Turn Management
- **Turn Start**: Clear visual indication of new turn
- **Action Completion**: Smooth transition to next phase
- **Waiting States**: Clear messaging about what's happening
- **Error Handling**: Friendly error messages for invalid actions

## 6. Testing & Debugging Features

### Development Tools
- **Game Log**: Scrollable area for all game events
- **Debug Info**: Match ID, player seats, game state
- **Auto Actions**: "Auto Turn" button for testing
- **State Inspection**: Easy access to current game state

### User Feedback
- **Loading States**: Spinners or progress indicators
- **Success Messages**: Confirmation of actions taken
- **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error descriptions
- **Help Text**: Tooltips and contextual help

## 7. Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Core Layout)
1. Implement the horizontal enemy/player division
2. Enhance the left sidebar counter display (now the win/loss mechanism)
3. Improve timer visibility and styling
4. Add player name displays

### Phase 2 (Card Interactions)
1. Enhance card selection visual feedback
2. Implement the card choice modal
3. Improve tableau card stacking/grouping
4. Add card movement animations

### Phase 3 (Polish)
1. Add smooth transitions and animations
2. Implement responsive design
3. Add accessibility features
4. Polish visual design and typography

## 8. Technical Considerations

### Performance
- **Card Rendering**: Efficient rendering of multiple cards
- **Animation Performance**: Smooth 60fps animations
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of event listeners
- **Network Efficiency**: Minimize API calls during gameplay

### Accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support
- **Screen Readers**: Proper ARIA labels and roles
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG AA compliance
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators

This design document provides a roadmap for implementing the wireframe ideas while enhancing them with modern UX principles and technical best practices.
