Story: Unity UI: hand, 2-card placement, opponent pick
AC: Timer UI; correct input gating; tutorial tips toggleable.

Task: Unity networking layer (WS client)
AC: Reconnect ≤5s; no duplicate actions after reconnect.

EP-03 — Online Matchmaking & Match Service

Story: Match service (authoritative) + WebSocket protocol
AC: p95 latency <150ms; desync <5%; replays re-simulate identically.

Task: Simple queue with bot backfill stub
AC: Median wait <15s (bots after 25s), bot seeded near player MMR.

AC: Winnable nodes; first-time tooltips; local progress saved.

Story (Soft Launch): Campaign full (12–20 nodes) & scaling bots
AC: Completion unlocks cosmetic; drop-off tracked.

EP-06 — Telemetry & AB Testing

Story: Telemetry foundation
AC: Events (match_start, card_played{id,tier}, lp_change, match_end, queue_wait); dashboards for avg match time, LP deltas.

Story (Soft Launch): AB testing & remote rules toggles
AC: Buckets, toggle “double LP=win”, timer variants, safe rollback.

EP-07 — Monetization: Store & Cosmetics & Ads (Soft Launch)
